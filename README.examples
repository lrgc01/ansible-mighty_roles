### Site with nginx server and PHP app using haproxy to load balance:

 - Be sure to have the key pair to connect to the server

 - The server must accept HTTP/HTTPS connections from internet on default ports (80/443)

 - change internal hosts on HA Proxy config:
   - var file group_vars/haproxy.yml
     - variable backend_servers_string_lines 

 - change db host in DB config:
   - var file group_vars/db_server.yml
     - variable db_host (which will feed db_list)
